"description":"It calculates frames/second over each updateInterval.It is also fairly accurate at very low FPS counts (<10).We do this not by simply counting frames per interval, butby accumulating FPS for each frame. This way we end up withcorrect overall FPS even if the interval renders something like 5.5 frames. credits: http://unifycommunity.com/wiki/index.php?title=FramesPerSecond"
